It had been developped mostly as part of my PhD project, which aims to understand the relationship between the brain, cognition and behavior, hence the focus on neuroscience data. As my project goes forward, new functionalities and scripts will be added. Contributions are welcome!.</p>"},{"location":"#dependencies","title":"Dependencies","text":"<p>Some of the statistical analyses available within NeuroStatX comes from the <code>semopy</code> package which requires Graphviz to properly visualize semplot. If you do not have Graphviz installed on your machine, please run the following:  <code>sudo apt get graphviz</code> for Linux users or <code>brew install graphviz</code> for MacOS users. Please note that the library will work even without Graphviz if you do not plan on using factorial analysis.</p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>To install the project, please follow these steps:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/gagnonanthony/NeuroStatX.git\ncd NeuroStatX/\npoetry install\n</code></pre> <p>If you plan on developping code, please use these steps to install all the required packages:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/gagnonanthony/NeuroStatX.git\ncd NeuroStatX/\npoetry install --with=dev,docs\n</code></pre> <p>Both of these commands will create a virtual environment. To access the library environment, you can use: <code>poetry shell</code> from within the project root directory. To avoid doing so each time you open a terminal, you can set the path to the source file of the environment in your .bashrc (or equivalent). Simply use these commands from within the project directory:</p> <pre><code>ENVPATH=$(poetry env info --path)\necho \"export NeuroStatXPATH=${ENVPATH}\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n</code></pre> <p>Restart your terminal. You should be able to activate the project virtual environment by using <code>source $NeuroStatXPATH/bin/activate</code>. </p>"},{"location":"#how-to-use","title":"How to use?","text":"<p>All CLI tools should be available directly from the command line if the virtual env is activated. Simply run <code>AddNodesAttributes --version</code> to validate.</p>"},{"location":"license/","title":"License","text":"<p>MIT License</p> <p>Copyright (c) 2023 gagnonanthony</p> <p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:</p> <p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.</p> <p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
