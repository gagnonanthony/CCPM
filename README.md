CCPM is a small toolbox to evaluate cognitive profile based on cognitive and behavioral data. 

## Installation

This library uses *poetry* to manage dependencies. To install it, use pipx with
the following command:

```
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry
```

> [!WARNING]
> Poetry is creating is own virtual environment by default. Therefore, be sure
> to deactivate all of your virtual environment before continuing on with the
> installation.

To install CCPM and all of its dependencies, run this set of commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/gagnonanthony/CCPM.git
cd CCPM/
poetry install
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `poetry install` command will install all required dependencies as well
> as setting up a virtual environment. To access the library environment, use:
> `poetry shell`. This will activate the project's python environment in your
> current shell.
> To access your environment from other directories, use this command (from
> within the project directory):
```
ENVPATH=$(poetry env info --path)
echo 'export ENVPATH=$ENVPATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```
> Restart your terminal. You should now be able to activate the poetry
> environment by using: `source $ENVPATH/bin/activate` from anywhere.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## INSTALLING GRAPHVIZ
> Graphviz is an external dependencies required to visualize semplot from the
> semopy package used within CCPM. If you do not have Graphviz installed on
> your machine, please run the following if you are on Linux `sudo apt get graphviz`
> or `brew install graphviz` if you are on MacOS.
