CCPM is a small toolbox to evaluate cognitive profile based on cognitive and behavioral data. 

Installation
============
To install this library, please do the following commands (virtual python
environment are recommended (e.g. virtualenv)) :

``git clone https://github.com/gagnonanthony/CCPM.git``

``cd CCPM``

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Temporarily, install semopy separately due to the legacy use of sklearn (an upcoming PR in pip will allow
to ignore package dependencies directly in requirements.txt).

``pip install semopy==2.3.9 --no-deps``

``pip install -e .``

Installing Graphviz
===================
In order to correctly use the visualisation function of ``semopy``, it
is suggested to install Graphviz in your base system.

_FOR MAC USERS:_

``brew install graphviz``

_FOR LINUX USERS:_

``sudo apt get graphviz``
